### Networks

Recently I've been working on building up my network. In 2023, alongside some colleagues at Durham, I helped to launch [NUMPEN](https://www.numpen.net/events/inaugural-meeting), a network for education-focused people in Maths departments around the North of the UK. We organise (semi-)regular events, and  we also have a Slack channel to keep the conversation going between events - email me for the link!

In 2025, I helped to organise the the [2025 STACK conference](https://sites.google.com/view/stack2025/home) in Durham. I designed our fancy logo:

and I also gave one of the plenary talks, based on the [final-year projects using STACK](/_posts/2025-06-06-students-writing-STACK.md) that I co-supervised with Sam Fearn.

There's a nice writeup about the event on the [University website](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/news/department-of-mathematical-sciences-hosted-international-stack-conference-2025/).



### Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion

I am a member of the Department’s Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion committee. As a PhD student, I helped to launch the Maths First-Generation Scholars Network, which connects students and staff who are the first in their families to attend university. Alongside Katie Gittins and Denis Pattinson, I’m once again helping to coordinate the network. With the support of the EDI committee, I also started a project which provides free sanitary products to all students and staff in the Mathematical and Computer Sciences departments.


### Outreach 

I do a lot of outreach/maths communcation stuff. I'm one of the editors of [Chalkdust magazine](https://www.chalkdustmagazine.com), where I write [quizzes](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/category/regulars/quiz/), give [advice to Dirichlet](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/category/regulars/dear-dirichlet/), and organise the sponsorship that keeps the magazine running. 

I also do a lot of overthinking about [Skittles](/skittles).
