title: "Peer assessment"
--- 

Although we all put a lot of effort into producing good feedback for students, we often find that they don't engage with it seriously (or at all). In an attempt to encourage students to build the skills they need to make the most of the feedback they're given, I have introduced peer assessment into several places in our Maths curriculum. 

My hope is that by giving students hands-on experience of critiquing others' work, we will encourage them to be more active participants in the feedback process, to look more critically at their own work, and that along the way they will start to develop their writing and presentation skills. 

In my session, I will reflect on my experience of introducing peer assessment into four Maths modules at Durham, ranging from the first year to the third: convincing my colleagues to try something new, encouraging students to engage with the activities, and using two different peer assessment platforms as part of an institutional trial. I hope this session will encourage others to try something similar in their own institutions, and give some advice/experience of how to get going.
