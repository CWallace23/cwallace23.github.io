I am an Assistant Professor in the Education group within the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Durham University. Previously I was a Teaching Fellow here, and I completed my PhD at Durham in 2021.

I'm [interested in](research):

- how students develop mathematical writing skills;
- whether peer assessment can help (and whether it's a good thing anyway);
-  how we talk about examples with students;
-  and e-assessment (particularly STACK).
